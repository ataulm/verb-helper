`src/main/assets/verbs.db` is from Fred Jehle's original work, compiled by @ghidinelli and [found here](https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs). I made some modifications, namely marking all fields as non-null and exporting as a `.db` file with [sqliteonline.com](https://sqliteonline.com/), and is Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License as where I got it from.
